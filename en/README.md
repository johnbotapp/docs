# :question: About John-Bot
**John-Bot is a bot offered on the Discord platform designed to facilitate the management of Discord servers where it is present.** It offers a large number of useful features, including a ticket system, a logging system, an arrival & departure system, an experience-based leveling system, a giveaway system, and an advanced moderation system.¹

# :book: Documentation
John-Bot's documentation is intended to familiarize you with the various features offered by John-Bot. It allows you to quickly find a written answer to the numerous questions that may arise when using John-Bot, particularly during its configuration.
Each page of the documentation is linked to a video tutorial. Find all official tutorials via this YouTube playlist: [Tutorials - John-Bot](https://jnbt.xyz/tutorials)

# :gear: Operation
The documentation is divided into several categories comprising pages and sub-pages. These sub-pages are divided into sections and even sub-sections. Such a structure may seem excessive and overly complex, but it actually allows you to find the answer to a question in just a few moments. Indeed, you can increasingly orient yourself towards the expected answer without having to search through the entire documentation for your answer.
<br/> Some symbols can also help you quickly understand certain information:

# :no_entry_sign: Limits
The documentation may sometimes not be able to answer one of your questions, in which case you can contact John-Bot's support team via the Discord support server or any other means².
