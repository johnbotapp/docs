## :question: About John-Bot

**John-Bot is a Discord bot designed to simplify the management of Discord servers.** It comes packed with a wide range of useful features, including a ticketing system, a logging system, join & leave actions, an XP-based leveling system, a giveaway system, and an advanced moderation system, among others.¹

## :book: Documentation

John-Bot's documentation is here to help you get familiar with everything John-Bot has to offer. It provides quick, written answers to the many questions that may come up while using the bot — especially during setup and configuration. Each documentation page is tied to a video tutorial. You can find all official tutorials in this YouTube playlist: [Tutorials - John-Bot](https://jnbt.xyz/tutorials)

## :gear: How It Works

The documentation is organized into several categories, each containing pages and sub-pages. These sub-pages are broken down into sections and even sub-sections. While this structure may seem complex at first, it actually makes it easy to find what you're looking for in just a few clicks. You can narrow down to the exact answer you need without having to dig through the entire documentation.
Some icons may also help you quickly identify certain information:

## :no_entry_sign: Limitations

The documentation may not always cover every question you have. If that's the case, feel free to reach out to John-Bot's support team through the Discord support server or any other available method².
