## :question: Frequently Asked Questions

<details>

<summary>What is John-Bot?</summary>

John-Bot is a bot available on the Discord platform designed to facilitate the management of Discord servers on which it is present. It offers a large number of useful features, including a ticket system, a logging system, a welcome & departure system, an experience-based leveling system, a giveaway system, and an advanced moderation system.ยน

<summary>Why can't the role I want be selected?</summary>

When configuring automatic roles or reward roles in the leveling system, you might encounter a role that cannot be selected. It appears grayed out, unselectable, and is followed by a red indicator. This could be due to two interferences:

* **Role not accessible by John-Bot**: For some roles, John-Bot simply does not have enough permissions. To grant these permissions, place the role named "John-Bot," which is the application role, above the desired roles in the server's role hierarchy. John-Bot must also have administrator permission (or at a minimum, "Manage Roles").

* **Role not manageable by John-Bot**: For some roles, Discord prohibits applications like John-Bot from managing them. This includes application roles and reward roles for server boosters.
