### :question: Frequently Asked Questions

<details>

<summary>What is John-Bot?</summary>

John-Bot is a Discord bot designed to simplify the management of Discord servers. It comes packed with a wide range of useful features, including a ticketing system, a logging system, join & leave actions, an XP-based leveling system, a giveaway system, and an advanced moderation system, among others.¹

<summary>Why can't I select the role I want?</summary>

When setting up autoroles or leveling reward roles, you may notice that some roles appear grayed out, are unselectable, and are marked with a red indicator. This can be caused by one of two issues:

* **Role not accessible by John-Bot**: John-Bot doesn't have enough permissions to manage this role. To fix this, move the role named "John-Bot" (the application role) above the desired roles in your server's role hierarchy. John-Bot must also have the Administrator permission (or at the very least, "Manage Roles").
* **Role not manageable by John-Bot**: Discord prevents bots from managing certain roles. This applies to other application roles and Server Booster reward roles.
