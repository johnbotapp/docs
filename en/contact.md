## :speech_balloon: Contact Support
Discover the different ways to contact the John-Bot team and choose the one that suits you best.

## Discord Support Server
The Discord support server is the fastest way to contact the team and allows you to submit most requests. Through a ticket systemÂ¹, each member of the support team instantly receives a notification and can respond directly in a temporary channel with their own Discord account.

<br/> To submit a request, join the [John-Bot Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/YgRbfQ3Mkg), go to the [#assistance](https://discord.com/channels/959269961572962314/960211222211489903) channel, and click the "Open a ticket" button on the corresponding message. The window that appears allows you to fill in the assistance reason to save time. If you still do not want to fill in this field, click directly on the blue "Send" button located at the bottom right of the window. After a few seconds of waiting, you will receive a confirmation message in the channel. It will indicate the channel where your request was created. Simply click on the name of the corresponding channel. You are now in the textual channel where communication with the team can take place. Wait for the team to respond or start the conversation to clarify your request.
