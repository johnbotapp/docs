## :speech_balloon: Discord Support Server

The Discord support server is the fastest way to reach the team and covers most types of requests. Through a ticket system¹, every support team member is instantly notified and can respond directly in a temporary channel using their own Discord account.

To submit a request, join the [John-Bot Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/YgRbfQ3Mkg), head to the [#support](https://discord.com/channels/959269961572962314/960211222211489903) channel, and click the ":flag_gb: English" button on the corresponding message.

The pop-up window lets you specify the reason for your request to save time. If you'd rather skip this step, just click the blue "Submit" button at the bottom right of the window.

After a few seconds, you'll receive a confirmation message in the channel with the name of the channel where your request was created. Simply click on that channel name. You'll now be in the text channel where you can communicate with the team. Wait for a response or start the conversation to describe your request.

## :e_mail: Email

**General inquiries:** [team@johnbot.app](mailto:team@johnbot.app)
