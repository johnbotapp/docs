## :rocket: Introduction

The embed system allows you to send a message, under the name of John-Bot, that can be edited in the future. This message can be enriched with various options that a regular user cannot use.

## :tools: Access the system

## Access the dashboard

First, go to the John-Bot dashboard through your preferred method. Learn how to do it: [How to access the dashboard](../../guide/guide.md#pushpin-access-the-dashboard)

## Access settings

Next, look for `Embed` on the right column, below your server's logo and banner. You will now be on a page where you can access all the settings related to the embed system.

# :pencil: Embed Configuration

## Create an embed

Before you start configuring your embeds, you need to create them. To do this, click on the `Create an embed` button located below the existing embeds if there are any.

## Duplicate an embed

You can also create an embed from an existing one to retain the exact same settings and customize it. This avoids having to reconfigure all the settings for a minor difference between the two embeds. To do this, simply click on the `Duplicate` button corresponding to the desired embed and confirm your choice in the window that appears.

## Edit an embed

To edit the settings of an existing embed, simply click on the `Edit` button corresponding to the desired embed.

## Delete an embed

To delete an existing embed, simply click on the `Delete` button corresponding to the desired embed and confirm your choice in the window that appears.

## Configure an embed

Once in the settings of an embed, you can configure many options to customize it according to your needs.
<br/> Once the configurations are completed, simply click on the green `Save & Edit` button located at the top right of the configuration window. If you do not want to save your changes, simply click `Cancel`.

## Save and send an embed

If your embed has just been created, you will need to create it using the `Create` button located at the top right. You will then need to send it to the predefined channel using the `Send` button.

### Message name

The message name allows server administrators to organize themselves in the John-Bot dashboard. It will not be visible to members. To set it, write it in the corresponding field.

### Send channel

The send channel is the channel in which the message containing the embed will be sent. To set it, choose the desired channel using the corresponding selection menu.

### Message

#### Text message

The text message is the text that will be displayed outside the embed, like a regular Discord user. You can use emojis and markdownÂ¹ to customize your text. To disable the text message, leave the field blank.

#### Embed

The embed is the part of the message that can contain several customizable elements and will be displayed below the text message. It cannot be sent by a regular Discord user. You can use the available fields to customize your embed.
