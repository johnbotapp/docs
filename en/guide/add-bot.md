# :envelope: Invitation Process
Once on the invitation page, select the server you want to add John-Bot to, then click "Continue." Make sure the "Administrator" permission is correctly assigned, then validate by clicking "Authorize." You may need to enter your two-factor authentication code ([2FA Support](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication)) or validate a CAPTCHA to prove you're not a robot.

# :hourglass: Finalization
After confirming the addition of John-Bot, make sure it is present on the server. If it is, it is advisable to move on to the next section of the startup guide. Otherwise, this is usually related to a misconfigured "antiraid" bot or a permissions issue.
